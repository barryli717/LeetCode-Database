## 0182. Duplicate Emails



### Problem

Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

| Id   | Email   |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1    | a@b.com |
| 2    | c@d.com |
| 3    | a@b.com |
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

| Email   |
|---------|
| a@b.com |

Note: All emails are in lowercase.



### Code



#### 1. `GROUP BY` and Subquery

```mysql
select Email from
(
  select Email, count(Email) as num
  from Person
  group by Email
) as statistic
where num >= 2
;
```



#### 2. `HAVING` and `GROUP BY`

```mysql
select Email
from Person
group by Email
having count(Email) >= 2;
```



**Notice**: the priority of operations

- `WHERE`>`GROUP BY`>`HAVING`>`ORDER BY`
