## 0180. Consecutive Numbers



### Problem

Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.


| Id | Num |
|----|-----|
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |

For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.


| ConsecutiveNums |
|-----------------|
| 1               |



### Code

```sql
SELECT 
	DISTINCT a.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs a,
    Logs b,
    Logs c
WHERE
    a.Id = b.Id - 1
    AND b.Id = c.Id - 1
    AND a.Num = b.Num
    AND b.Num = c.Num
;
```



### Summary

- Self-join for 3 times, where `Num` in all 3 tables are the same, but their `Id` have a difference of 1;
- If the `Id` in the table is not continuous, we could add a column of row numbers to fulfill the operations;
