## 0569. Median Employee Salary



### Problem

The Employee table holds all employees. The employee table has three columns: Employee Id, Company Name, and Salary.


|Id   | Company    | Salary |
|-----|------------|--------|
|1    | A          | 2341   |
|2    | A          | 341    |
|3    | A          | 15     |
|4    | A          | 15314  |
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|7    | B          | 15     |
|8    | B          | 13     |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|10   | B          | 1345   |
|11   | B          | 1221   |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|13   | C          | 2345   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |
|15   | C          | 2645   |
|16   | C          | 2652   |
|17   | C          | 65     |

Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.


|Id   | Company    | Salary |
|-----|------------|--------|
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |



### Code

```sql
select 
    b.id,
    b.company,
    b.salary
from 
    (
    select 
        id,
        company,
        salary,
        if(@com = company, @rk:=@rk+1, @rk:=1) as rank,
        @com:=company
    from employee,(select @rk:=0, @com:='') a 
    order by company,salary
    ) b
left join 
    (
    select 
        company,
        count(1) as cnt
    from employee 
    group by company
    ) c
on b.company=c.company
where 
    abs(b.rank - (cnt+1)/2) < 1;
```



### Summary

- Create a `rank` of salaries in each company, and a `cnt` of total employees of each company, so that we can index the median through `rank` and `cnt`;
- The median have the property that `abs(rank - (cnt+1)/2) < 1`, use this as filter;
- `select @var:=xxx` declares a local variable in the query, we can use two local variables `rk` and `com` to create a `rank` column without using window functions;
