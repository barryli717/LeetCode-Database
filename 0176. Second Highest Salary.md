## 0176. Second Highest Salary



### Problem

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.


| Id | Salary |
|----|---|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.


| SecondHighestSalary |
|---|
| 200                 |



### Code

```sql
select
	(select 
   	distinct(Salary)
   from Employee
   order by Salary desc
   limit 1 offset 1) as SecondHighestSalary
```



### Summary

- `limit 1 offset 1` means skip 1 result and get 1 result;
- Use subquery to avoid the error when there is no second highest salary (only 1 or less data);



### Additional Knowledge

- `limit y`: read `y` entries;
- `limit x,y`: skip `y` entries and read `x` entries;
- `limit y offset x`: skip `y` entries and read `x` entries;
