## 0196. Delete Duplicate Emails



### Problem

Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.


| Id | Email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |

Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:


| Id | Email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |



### Code

```sql
DELETE 
    a 
FROM Person a
JOIN Person b
ON a.Email = b.Email 
WHERE a.Id > b.Id
```



### Summary

- Use self-join, filter out the larger `Id` in table `a` then delete them;
