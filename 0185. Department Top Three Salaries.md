## 0185. Department Top Three Salaries



### Problem

The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.


| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
|:----|:-------|:--------|:--------------|
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |

The Department table holds all departments of the company.


| Id | Name     |
|----|----------|
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |

Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).


| Department | Employee | Salary |
|------------|----------|--------|
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |

Explanation:

In IT department, Max earns the highest salary, both Randy and Joe earn the second highest salary, and Will earns the third highest salary. There are only two employees in the Sales department, Henry earns the highest salary while Sam earns the second highest salary.



### Code

```sql
select
b.Name as Department
, a.Name as Employee 
, a.Salary as Salary
from
(
    select 
        dense_rank() over (partition by DepartmentId order by Salary desc) as rank,             
        DepartmentId,
        Name,
        Salary
    from Employee
) a
join Department b
on a.DepartmentId = b.Id
where
a.rank <= 3
```



### Summary

- Create a subquery which gives a ranking to `Salary` in each `DepartmentId`;
- Join the subquery with `Department` then select all entries which satisfy the condition of `rank <= 3`.



### Additional Knowledge

#### 1. `rank()` functions

- `rank()`: a ranking like `1,2,3,3,3,6,7, ...`;
- `dense_rank()`: a ranking like `1,2,3,3,3,4,5, ...`;
- `row_num()`: it's the row number like `1,2,3,4,,5,6,7, ...`;

#### 2. Analytical (window) functions

- Analytic functions are also called "(analytic) window functions" in the SQL standard and some commercial databases. This is because an analytic function is evaluated over a group of rows, referred to as a `window` or `window frame`.

- General structure

```sql
analytic_function_name ( [ argument_list ] )
  OVER (
    [ PARTITION BY partition_expression_list ]
    [ ORDER BY expression [{ ASC | DESC }] [, ...] ]
    [ window_frame_clause ]
  )
```

An analytic function requires an `OVER` clause, which defines the `window frame` that the analytic function is evaluated over. The `OVER` clause contains the following three optional clauses. BigQuery evaluates the sub-clauses of an `OVER` clause in the order in which they are written.

- A `PARTITION BY` clause divides the input rows into partitions, similar to `GROUP BY` but without actually combining rows with the same key.
- An `ORDER BY` clause specifies the ordering within each partition.
- A `window_frame_clause` defines the `window frame` within the current partition.
